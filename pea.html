        <p>Pea soup is a comforting and nutritious dish made primarily from dried green peas, which are simmered with various ingredients to create a hearty and flavorful soup. The peas are typically cooked with vegetables such as onions, carrots, and celery, and often with the addition of ham or bacon for added richness. Seasonings like thyme, bay leaves, and pepper are commonly used to enhance the taste. Once cooked, the ingredients are blended or mashed to achieve a smooth and creamy texture. Pea soup is enjoyed worldwide for its simplicity, warmth, and comforting taste.</p>

        <p>THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the dried green peas under cold water and soak them in water overnight or for at least 8 hours. This will help them cook faster and more evenly.</li>
            <li>Drain and rinse the soaked peas before cooking.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat a little oil or butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions, carrots, and celery to the pot. Saut√© them until they become tender and slightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>If you're using ham or bacon, you can add it to the pot now and cook until it releases its flavors.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked and rinsed peas to the pot.</li>
            <li>Pour in enough water or vegetable broth to cover all the ingredients in the pot.</li>
            <li>Add thyme and bay leaves for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Check if the peas are tender. They should be soft and mushy when done.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaves from the pot.</li>
            <li>Using a blender or an immersion blender, carefully blend the soup until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>If the soup is too thick, you can add more water or broth to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring the soup back to a simmer and let it cook for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Your delicious pea soup is now ready to be served! Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.</li>

        <h2>GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTY!</h2>
        <p>THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT!</p>
        <ol>

            <li>Heat a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add butter or cooking oil to the pan and let it melt.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes until it becomes translucent.</li>
            <li>If using garlic, add minced garlic to the pan and cook for an additional 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook for about 5 minutes until they are tender and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Push the onions and mushrooms to one side of the pan, and add the chicken pieces to the other side.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken until it's browned on all sides and cooked through (no pink in the center).</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix the sour cream with chicken broth until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the sour cream mixture into the pan with the chicken, onions, and mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Stir in Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce (if using) for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Season the mixture with paprika, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the stroganoff simmer for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>If the sauce seems too thick, you can add more chicken broth to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken stroganoff is ready, garnish with chopped fresh parsley for a pop of color and added freshness.</li>
            <li>Serve the Chicken Stroganoff over cooked egg noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes for a hearty and satisfying meal.</li>
